# Site Fixed - Ready to Re-Upload

**Date:** December 1, 2025
**Status:** FIXED AND READY

---

## What Was Wrong

The previous build was **incomplete**. The `/out/_next/static/` folder was missing critical files:

```
Previous build (broken):
out/_next/static/
├── WykHU8OsXrcgcIanLwDZI/ (only manifest files)
└── (NO chunks, NO css, NO media) ⟵ THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
```

Without these files, the browser couldn't load:
- JavaScript (galaxy effect, buttons, interactions)
- CSS (all styling)
- Fonts (Inter font family)

Result: **Blank or broken page**

---

## What's Fixed Now

A complete clean rebuild was done. The new `/out` folder now has **everything**:

```
Current build (working):
out/_next/static/
├── WykHU8OsXrcgcIanLwDZI/
├── chunks/          ⟵ 11 JavaScript files (1.0 MB)
├── css/             ⟵ Compiled Tailwind styles
└── media/           ⟵ Inter font files
```

**Total Size:** 1.4 MB
**All Assets:** Present
**Email Updated:** anthony@recollect.bio

## How to Re-Upload (IMPORTANT)

### Step 1: Delete Everything on Your Server First

**CRITICAL:** You need to delete the old broken files on your server first!

Using FileZilla or your SFTP client:

1. Connect to your hosting server
2. Navigate to your web root folder
3. **Delete everything** in that folder (or at least delete the `_next` folder)
4. The folder should be completely empty

### Step 2: Upload the NEW Files

1. **Local (left side):** Navigate to `/Users/anthony/Projects/Halos/halosbiolanding/out/`
2. **Remote (right side):** Make sure you're in your web root (should be empty now)
3. **Select ALL files/folders inside `out/`:**
   - `_next/` folder (most important!)
   - `404/` folder
   - `privacy/` folder
   - `terms/` folder
   - `index.html`
   - `logo.svg`
   - `robots.txt`
   - `sitemap.xml`
   - etc.
4. **Drag to upload** (or right-click → Upload)
5. **Wait ~5-10 minutes** for complete upload
6. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure `_next/static/chunks/` folder uploads completely

### Step 3: Verify Upload

After upload completes, your server folder should look like:

```
your-web-root/
├── _next/
│   └── static/
│       ├── chunks/        ⟵ Should have 11 .js files
│       ├── css/           ⟵ Should have .css file
│       └── media/         ⟵ Should have font files
├── 404/
├── privacy/
├── terms/
├── index.html
├── logo.svg
├── robots.txt
└── sitemap.xml
```

**Check the `chunks` folder specifically** - it should contain these files:
- `20-81ddebf42c70a867.js` (26 KB)
- `46-a2923bbfc58921c0.js` (323 KB) ⟵ Largest file
- `731-a08e47dd93475b96.js` (125 KB)
- `e6fd6439-2f31d71e9e5d61c5.js` (173 KB)
- `framework-6e06c675866dc992.js` (140 KB)
- `main-75c6716b4c889668.js` (117 KB)
- `main-app-8aa4d266a5755240.js` (463 bytes)
- `polyfills-42372ed130431b0a.js` (113 KB)
- `webpack-c475b98fbc183bfc.js` (4 KB)
- Plus `/app` and `/pages` subfolders

## Test Your Site

After uploading, visit your domain.

You should see:

- Galaxy animation working
- Black background with proper styling
- "Join Waitlist" button opens dialog
- "Investor/Partner Inquiry" opens email to `anthony@recollect.bio`
- Privacy and Terms pages work
- Mobile responsive design

---

## Troubleshooting

### If the site still doesn't work:

1. **Clear your browser cache:**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

2. **Check the browser console:**
   - Right-click on page → Inspect → Console tab
   - Look for 404 errors on JavaScript files
   - If you see errors like `Failed to load /_next/static/chunks/...`, the chunks didn't upload

3. **Verify files uploaded:**
   - In FileZilla, navigate to `/_next/static/chunks/`
   - You should see 11 JavaScript files
   - Largest should be `46-a2923bbfc58921c0.js` at ~323 KB

4. **Check file permissions:**
   - Right-click on `_next` folder in FileZilla
   - File Permissions → Should be `755` (or `drwxr-xr-x`)

5. **Re-upload just the `_next` folder:**
   - Delete the `_next` folder on the server
   - Upload the fresh `_next` folder from your local `/out/` directory
